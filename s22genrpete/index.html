                    <h2>How it started</h2>
                    <p>Back in 1965, Chevrolet entered the model year looking to overtake Ford in all their categories - small sized, mid-sized and full-sized cars with the Nova, Chevelle and Impala, respectively. And overtake Ford they did: the Nova and Chevelle won the small and mid-sized market, while the freshly redesigned Impala outright dominated Ford in the full-sized market.</p> 
                    <p>But then, Ford hit Chevrolet with a curveball - they created a fourth category, the pony car, with the introduction of the Ford Mustang. Now Chevrolet was in a rush to design and build a rival to the Mustang and so, Chevrolet's Head at the time, Semon Knutsen took the guys in charge for the record-setting Impala and told them to make a car to destroy the Mustang and they got to work. This new car was code-named "Panther". And so, starts the story of the Camaro.</p>

                        <p><i>"The Panther is dead; long live the Camaro."</i></p>
                        <p>The first generation of the Chevrolet Camaro entered production in fall of 1966 for the 1967 model year. It rode on a brand-new RWD GM F-body platform,
                            a platform that would be used by all Camaros all the way up to 2002, the year the 4th generation Camaro left production.</p>
                        <p>As standard, the 1st gen Camaro came with either a 3.8L inline-6 engine or a 5.4L V8, with a 5.0L V8 getting added as an option in January 1969, mated to a 3-speed manual transmission. 
                            Aside from the previously mentioned engines, there were many more engines available, as well as multiple automatic and manual transmissions. 
                            There also were a plethora of other options and packages available, most notably the COPO. Back then, GM forbade Chevrolet to install engines larger than 6.6L in displacement in cars like the Camaro.
                            Despite this, following the requests of several US dealers, Chevrolet found a way around this - they used an ordering process typically reserved for special orders to offer 
                            7.0L engines in the Camaro. And thus, the two Central Office Production Order (COPO) Camaros, numbers 9560 and 9561, were born. 
                            The most powerful of the two, the COPO 9560, used the ZL-1 engine - a badge that would return with the 5th gen Camaro.
                            The 1st gen Camaro was offered in two body styles - a 2-door hardtop and a 2-door convertible.</p>
                        <p>The 1st generation would remain in production until February 26, 1970, making this the shortest-lived generation of the Camaro to this day, only lasting 3 years. 
                            In total, 699 138 first gen Camaros were produced.</p>

                        <p><i>"Camaro. The hugger."</i></p>
                        <p>The second generation of the Chevrolet Camaro was introduced in the spring of 1970, with production starting in February of the same year. 
                            This Camaro's design was heavily influenced by European sports cars of the time. 
                            It would also change drastically over the course of its 11 years on the market with three major facelifts and at one point nearly got cancelled due to several major federal changes and large worker strikes.</p>
                        <p>The base engine for most of this generation's life was a 4.1L inline-6 engine mated to a 3-speed manual transmission. 
                            The base inline-6 would be replaced by a 3.8L V6 engine in 1980. 
                            Due to several factors, such as an oil crisis and changes in federal regulations, the 2nd gen Camaro would change a lot, inside and out - on top of several facelifts, engines would get pretty much neutered 
                            as Chevrolet tried to meet the increasingly strict federal regulations. Engine power peaked in 1971 and never fully recovered, at least not in the 2nd generation.
                            The 2nd gen Camaro was initally only offered as a 2-door coupe, with a t-top option arriving in 1978 - a convertible option wasn't offered.</p>
                        <p>The 2nd generation Camaro left production in 1981, with 1 936 869 cars produced in total.</p>

                        <p><i>"IROC 'n Roll Camaro"</i></p>
                        <p>The third generation of the Chevrolet Camaro launched in the fall of 1981. This Camaro's styling was futuristic for its time, with a new liftback design replacing the more traditional trunk.
                                <em>Motor Trend</em> magazine awarded the 1982 Camaro Z/28 their "Car of the Year" award. 
                                Another noteworthy thing is this is the first Camaro with fuel injection from the factory and by 1988, the entire engine line-up was fuel injected.</p>
                        <p>The base model initially came equipped with a 2.5L inline-4 engine, dubbed "Iron Duke", replaced by a 2.8L V6 in 1986, that then replaced by a 3.1L V6 in 1990. 
                            The 3-speed manual transmission was dropped for this generation, leaving the 4-speed manual as the base transmission, with the 5-speed transmission, introduced in 1983, replacing the 4-speed in 1986. 
                            V8 options were available, with a couple of automatic transmission options. One option that is often associated with the 3rd gen Camaro is the IROC-Z. IROC stands for International Race of Champions, which was a North American auto racing competition. 
                            This competition was special because everyone raced the same cars, meaning winning came down to driver skill.
                            The Camaro was the car of choice for the IROC between 1975 to 1989. To commemorate this and IROC's return from hiatus in 1984 (the series wasn't run in '81, '82 or '83), the IROC-Z was created.
                            The IROC-Z package was introduced as an option for the Z28 in 1985 and replaced the Z28 as the new top trim level in 1988. 
                            This package included upgraded suspension components, wheels, tires and an optional Tuned Port Injection system from the Corvette, leading some to call this the "Camaro that thinks it's a Corvette".
                            The 3rd generation Camaro was initially available as a 2-door liftback, with the 2-door convertible option returning in 1987.</p>
                        <p>The last 3rd generation Camaro rolled off the production line in August 28th, 1992, with 1 528 561 built in total.</p>

                        <p>The fourth generation of the Chevrolet Camaro, lovingly named "Catfish" by enthusiasts, entered production in November 1992. 
                            Though the size of this car remained similar to the 3rd gen model, the exterior, as well as interior was all new - the interior now included dual airbags, 
                            a conventional glovebox along with analog instrument displays and a tachometer.</p>
                        <p>For this generation, the inline engines were dropped entirely, with the base model now featuring a 3.4L V6 engine that got replaced by a 3.8L V6 in 1996, mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. 
                            While on the subject of engines, it would be a crime not to mention the LS1 5.7L V8, the first of the legendary LS V8 engines. 
                            The LS1 first appeared in the 1997 Chevrolet Corvette and got introduced to the Camaro in the facelifted 1998 model. 
                            The 4th generation Camaro was offered as a 2-door liftback coupe, a 2-door t-top and a 2-door convertible.</p>
                        <p>With the last 4th generation Camaro rolling off the production line on August 27th, 2002, 
                            the Chevrolet Camaro was discontinued entirely for 8 long years due to declining sales. Over 600 000 cars were produced in total for the 4th generation.</p>

                        <p>This is, possibly, the best-known generation of the Camaro, the alien robot we all know and love (or tolerate, if you were a parent at the time of the first Transformers movie's release), 
                            the fifth generation of the Chevrolet Camaro. 
                            This generation was first unveiled in January 9, 2006 as the Camaro Concept Coupe and, in March 16, 2009, the Camaro began production for the 2010 model year. 
                            This generation of the Camaro, styling-wise, was retro-inspired and brought back legendary badges such as the COPO, carried by the non-street-legal drag racing focused limited production model, and ZL1, carried by the high-performance variant of the SS.
                            Underneath, however, it was a proper and modern sports car - in fall of 2011, a ZL1 Camaro lapped the Nurburgring in 7:41:27, placing it in the same class as cars like 
                            the Lamborghini Murcielago and Porsche 911 Turbo S.</p>
                        <p>The base model Camaro came equipped with a 3.6L V6 engine, with a choice between a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic gearbox. 
                            Aside from the base V6, the 5th gen came with both naturally aspirated and supercharged V8s - a first for the Camaro. 
                            This generation of the Camaro was available as a 2-door coupe or a 2-door convertible.</p>
                        <p>The last 5th gen Camaro was produced on November 20th, 2015, with 559 953 produced in total.</p>

                        <p><i>"Makes every lane the fast one."</i></p>
                        <p>The sixth generation Camaro was announced to the public on May 16, 2015 and went on sale that same year for the 2016 model year. 
                            General Motors, Chevrolet's parent company, claims that 70 percent of this Camaro's components are unique to it. 
                            Interestingly enough, the 6th gen Camaro is smaller than its predecessor - it is 58mm shorter, 20mm narrower and 28mm lower.</p>
                        <p>The base model this time around had a 2.0L turbocharged inline-4 engine - the first inline engine in a Camaro since the 3rd gen model, while the standard transmission was a 6-speed manual. 
                            The 2.0L I4 was discontinued for the 2024 model year, alongside the base-model trim and some cosmetic options as GM gets ready for the second discontinuation of the Camaro. 
                            The 6th generation Camaro is available as either a 2-door coupe or 2-door convertible.</p>
                        <p>Production of the 6th gen Camaro is planned to end in January of 2024. 
                            To celebrate the Camaro, Chevrolet has introduced a Collector's Edition for the 2024 model year Camaro.</p>
