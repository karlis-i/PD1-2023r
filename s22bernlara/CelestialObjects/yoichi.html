                Yoichi is a coastal town, with beaches Moire kaisuiyokujo. Yoichi is popular with surfers from autumn through to spring, but in summer there is little swell, and the coastline is better suited to kayaking and swimming. In July and August, the beaches are popular with campers and other tourists. Many people pass Yoichi on their way to explore Shakotan peninsula or Niseko. Yoichi is also close to local club ski fields such as Niki Ski Field.[6] There are also many walks in the back country in the hills behind Yoichi.
