        <h2>Who is Neptune? </h2>
        <p>
            Neptune  is the Roman god of freshwater and the seain Roman religion.

            Depictions of Neptune in Roman mosaics, especially those in North Africa, were influenced by Hellenistic conventions. He was likely associated with freshwater springs before the sea. Like Poseidon, he was also worshipped by the Romans as a god of horses, as Neptunus equestris (a patron of horse-racing).
