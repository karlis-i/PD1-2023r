            I'm originally from southeast Brazil but I decided to make Latvia my home in 2021 for my Computer Science studies at Ventspils Augstskola. I'm in my second year (2ITB-Class) and loving every bit of it. When I'm not busy with tech stuff, you'll find me lost in the pages of a good book or listening to some great tunes!
        </p>

            Tech is my thing, though! I've been getting the hang of different programming languages like C, C++, C#, Python, Java, and PHP. Lately, I've been also exploring the creative side of things with CSS and HTML, learning how to make websites look awesome and work smoothly. My first project, "Somewhere In The Stars," is a little peek into this journey of mine. I had a lot of fun putting it together, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I did creating it. Thanks a bunch for stopping by!
