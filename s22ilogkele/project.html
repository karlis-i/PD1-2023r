                                                        Polyphenols are an interesting area of study in nutrition. Previously, they were believed to have direct anti-oxidant effects,

                                                <h3>However, the vast majority of this carbohydrate comes from fiber, with 33 grams of fibrous carbs per 100 grams.

                                                        Compared to simple sugars and starch, our body does not break soluble fiber down into glucose, so it does not affect blood glucose or insulin levels.
